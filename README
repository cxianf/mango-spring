This is a very easy tool to use mongodb in java driver with spring , u can operate it by coding words as the mongodb shell words.
e.g.  colloection.findOne("{'name':'mazhiyuan'}").as()

Notes:
--> The Model class needs extends the super class Madel.class
--> The Model class needs a default constructor
--> This tool doesn't have a operate 'insert' , use 'save' instead of
--> This tool also doesn't the operate 'group' , this would fix one day , or u fix it if u want and share the word to me.
--> Read Mazhiyuan.class and MangoTest.class ,u can know how to use this tool , the details will public later in my blog mazhiyuan.iteye.com

about the name 'mango' 
mango is not the fruit ‘mango’,it comes from mazhiyuan + mongo = mango
The almost of ideas from the amazing project jongo (jongo.org) , I review some apis and offer some methods we use often,and make it integrate with spring,
u can use the properties files to change the configuration of mongodb softly.
